# Spring-157
Spring-157 Compression Quantum Python Software

Algorithm Spring-157:
Repeat many 1 or many times Number_of_the_file=((((Number_of_the_file*add_ones_together)+Add)//3)*T_Real)//Divided_corrdiates and Times Reality. Also, Second Times=T14

cp=circuit polynomial

How to use: pip install qiskit

General-purpose compression

Need for Spring-157 Quantum computer cubits (2**24)+2 and 32 bits
